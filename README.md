## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation  
Performed in the **workingsheet** tab:  

- **Duplicates removed** to ensure data consistency.  
- **Categorical values standardized** (e.g., Marital Status “M/S” → Married/Single).  
- **Missing values handled** using logical assumptions.  
- **New calculated fields created**, such as:  
  - Age groups (e.g., 0–30, 31–45, 46–60, 61+).  
  - Purchase segmentation.  

Tools & Techniques used:  
- Excel **Text-to-Columns** & **Find/Replace**  
- **IF statements** for categorization  
- **Data Validation** for standardization  
- **Conditional Formatting** for data quality checks

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualization  
Analysis was summarized in the **Dashboard** tab using:  
- **PivotTables** (for summarization & aggregation).  
- **PivotCharts** (bar charts, pie charts, column charts).  
- **Slicers & Timelines** (for interactivity).  
- **KPIs & Segmentation** (customer purchase trends).  

Key Analysis Dimensions:  
- Age vs. Bike Purchase  
- Income vs. Bike Purchase  
- Commute Distance impact  
- Occupation & Education trends  
- Regional distribution

## 🎯 Key Insights  
- **Age Factor**: Customers aged **31–45** are most likely to purchase a bike.  
- **Income Bracket**: Purchases peak between **$40,000 – $70,000 annual income**.  
- **Commute Distance**: Short commutes (0–5 miles) strongly increase purchase likelihood.  
- **Occupation Trends**: Professionals and Skilled Manual workers show higher conversion.  
- **Demographic Segments**: Married individuals purchase more than singles.
